### 🚀 My Current Roadmap

I am following a structured development plan to build a robust skill set for an AI/ML Engineer role.

- 🌱 **Foundation Phase (Q4 2025):** Mastering the fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Learning.
  - Parallel completion of **Atıl Samancıoğlu's comprehensive Udemy AI Course** and **DataCamp's "Associate Data Scientist in Python" Track**.
  - **Core Focus:** Python, Pandas, SQL, Data Visualization, and core ML algorithms with Scikit-learn.

- 🏆 **Specialization Phase (Q1 2026):** Leveling up to production-grade AI engineering.
  - Targeting the **Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer** certification.
  - Studying **DataCamp's "Machine Learning Engineer" Track** to learn MLOps and production best practices.

- 🛠️ **Application Phase (Ongoing):** Proving my skills through hands-on work.
  - Preparing for **Kaggle** competitions to benchmark my modeling skills.
  - Developing a portfolio of end-to-end projects involving **web scraping, API development (FastAPI/Flask), and cloud integration**.
